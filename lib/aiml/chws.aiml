        <pattern>HOW DOES A CHILLED WATER SYSTEM WORK?</pattern>
        <template>A chilled water system operates through the following steps:
        1. A chiller cools the water by removing heat through a refrigeration cycle, typically using compressors, evaporators, condensers, and expansion valves.
        2. The chilled water is then circulated through a closed-loop piping system, which distributes it to the cooling coils or AHUs.
        3. Cooling coils or AHUs use the chilled water to absorb heat from the surrounding air, reducing its temperature and dehumidifying it.
        4. The now-warmed chilled water returns to the chiller, where the heat is removed, and the cycle repeats.
        The chilled water system is controlled by a network of sensors, valves, and controls to maintain desired temperatures and ensure efficient operation.</template>

    <pattern>TELL ME ABOUT THE CHILLER IN A CHILLED WATER SYSTEM.</pattern>
    <template>
      The chiller is a key component of a chilled water system. It is responsible for cooling the water that circulates through the system. The chiller utilizes a refrigeration cycle to extract heat from the water and transfer it to a cooling medium, such as air or water. It consists of several main components:
      - Compressor: The compressor increases the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant gas, enabling it to absorb heat from the chilled water.
      - Evaporator: The evaporator is a heat exchanger where the refrigerant evaporates, absorbing heat from the chilled water and causing the refrigerant to turn into a gas.
      - Condenser: The condenser is another heat exchanger that removes heat from the refrigerant gas and transfers it to a cooling medium, allowing the refrigerant to condense back into a liquid state.
      - Expansion Valve: The expansion valve regulates the flow of the refrigerant, reducing its pressure and temperature as it enters the evaporator.
      Chillers can be air-cooled or water-cooled, with each type offering its own advantages and considerations depending on the specific application and system requirements.
